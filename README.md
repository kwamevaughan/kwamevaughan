## 🧠 Bonus Skill: SEO That Slaps

Not to brag (okay maybe a little), but I’m also really good at **SEO optimization**—from structured data and clean semantic HTML to performance tweaks and meta tag magic.  
I’ve helped apps and websites soar to the top of Google Search results through:

- 🔍 **Keyword research** using tools like **Ahrefs** and **SEMrush**  
- ⚡ **Performance optimizations** (hello, Core Web Vitals!)  
- 🧑‍💻 **On-page SEO**: Clean code, semantic HTML, and well-crafted meta tags  
- 📈 **Content strategy**: Helping businesses rank and stand out
- 📊 **Google Analytics**: Setting up and configuring GA to track traffic, user behavior, and conversions  
- 🖥️ **Google Search Console**: Submitting sitemaps, fixing errors, and analyzing search performance  
- 🏷️ **Google Tag Manager**: Efficiently managing marketing tags without extra code or headaches
- 💨 **Page Speed Optimization**: I use tools like **Lighthouse** and **WebPageTest** to ensure a site is fast and delivers top-tier performance.  
- 🚀 **SEO Audits & Reporting**: I regularly audit sites to improve search visibility and drive organic growth. 

If your app or site isn’t ranking, I’ll help it climb like it’s training for Everest.

- 🧱 Custom CMS/WordPress themes that even non-techies love  
- 📡 Develop APIs that talk fluently (REST and GraphQL both speak to me)  
- 🚀 Deploy with **CI/CD pipelines** so smooth they should be illegal
